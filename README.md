# Linked List Data Structure in JavaScript

## Overview

This project implements a singly linked list data structure using modern JavaScript (ES6). It leverages ES6 features such as classes and modules to provide a clear, organized, and reusable codebase.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Implements the linked list using modern JavaScript features 
- **Classes**: `Node` and `LinkedList` classes encapsulate the behavior and properties of nodes and the linked list.
- **Modules**: ES6 modules (`import` and `export`) ensure modularity and reusability of code.
- **Recursive and Iterative Approaches**: Used for different linked list operations.

## Features

- Both head and tail pointers.
- Append a new node to the end of the list.
- Prepend a new node to the start of the list.
- Calculate the size (length) of the list.
- Retrieve the head node of the list.
- Retrieve the tail node of the list.
- Return the node at a specific index.
- Remove the last node from the list.
- Check if a value is contained in the list.
- Find the index of a node containing a specific value.
- Convert the list to a string representation.
- Insert a node at a specific index.
- Remove a node at a specific index.
